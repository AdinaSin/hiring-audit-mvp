- **RED blocks:** Start with Quick Wins immediately, begin Structural within 2 weeks
- **YELLOW blocks:** Quick Wins within 2 weeks, Structural as capacity allows
- **Cross-validation contradictions:** Address with CROSS recommendations first

## By Resource Availability
- **Limited resources:** Focus on Quick Wins only; prioritize Gate blocks (B1, B2, B4)
- **Moderate resources:** Quick Wins + 1-2 Structural changes per block
- **Full investment:** Complete roadmap with Strategic recommendations

## By Business Impact
- **Revenue-critical hiring:** Prioritize B3 (interview bottleneck) and B5 (evaluation)
- **Cost pressure:** Prioritize B4 (financial governance) and agency spend
- **Compliance risk:** Prioritize B7 (AI governance, GDPR)
